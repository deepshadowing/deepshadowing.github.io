Barn Find Buick Grand National", "description": "This is a 1987 Buick Grand National that has 56 original miles found in Columbus Ohio and trailered back to NYC. We are pulling it out of the garage and giving it its first wash in 34 years! The Buick Grand National was faster than the Chevy Corvette in 1987 and was called \"Darth Vaders Car\" in various automotive publications. After we remove it from the Barn, we trailered it up to the AMMO Studio for a full restoration detail, foam wash, black paint polish with Rupes buffer, AMMO Reflex Pro, and a reveal to the owner at the very end of the episode. Be sure to watch the last clip of him starting the car for the very first time.

Click https://www.carwow.co.uk/help-me-carwow and my team and I will help you choose your ideal car at a fair price - from Mat Watson!\n.............................................................\n\nIt\u2019s the Mercedes hot hatch drag race you\u2019ve been waiting for. We\u2019ve got the AMG A45 S going up against its baby brother, the AMG A35!\n\nNow before you leave a negative comment on the video, we know what you\u2019re thinking - the result is, of course, a foregone conclusion. Although both cars are packing 2-litre turbocharged petrol engines, their performances are actually quite different. The A35 will produce 306hp and 400Nm, while the A45 S\u2019s hand-built engine puts down 421hp and 500Nm! \n\nHowever, there\u2019s one key stat where the A35 wins - the price! Coming in \u00a313,000 lower, the A35 is easily one of the best value mid-range hot hatches out there. The question is, should you splash out on the A45 S, or are you going to get enough performance from the A35 that you should just save yourself \u00a313,000?\n\nThere\u2019s only one way to find out\u2026 LET\u2019S RACE!\n\n.............................................................\n\nInstagram \u2013 http://www.instagram.com/carwow\n\nTiktok - https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow\n\nFacebook \u2013 http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk\n\nTwitter \u2013 http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk\n\nAwkward haggling is a thing of the past with carwow.

We\u2019ve got the AMG A45 S going up against its baby brother, the AMG A35!\n\nNow before you leave a negative comment on the video, we know what you\u2019re thinking - the result is, of course, a foregone conclusion. Although both cars are packing 2-litre turbocharged petrol engines, their performances are actually quite different. The A35 will produce 306hp and 400Nm, while the A45 S\u2019s hand-built engine puts down 421hp and 500Nm! \n\nHowever, there\u2019s one key stat where the A35 wins - the price! Coming in \u00a313,000 lower, the A35 is easily one of the best value mid-range hot hatches out there.
